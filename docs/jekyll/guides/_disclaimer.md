Since {{site.github.repository_name}} is a TypeScript-first package, all examples
will be in TypeScript. You can of course choose to ignore the type annotations
and use the package in plain JavaScript.

The guide assumes that you already have a minimal MobX/React environment with
some kind of bundler like Webpack set up. If not, google around for tutorials
such as [this one](https://medium.com/teachable/getting-started-with-react-typescript-mobx-and-webpack-4-8c680517c030),
or just use some boilerplates (here's one for
[JavaScript](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-boilerplate)
and here for [TypeScript](https://github.com/rokoroku/react-mobx-typescript-boilerplate))
